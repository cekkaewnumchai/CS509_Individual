# CS509_Individual
Chaiwat Ekkaewnumchai Individual Project for CS509

## Notable Remark

### Installation:
- Please add external library to the project (in `lib/`) 

### How to use:
- Run Main.java
- Click on enabled buttons to process
- In case of textfields, format is indicated inside parentheses
	- for example, YYYY/MM/DD indicates 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day
- Some operations may require addition steps
	- for example, to "Schedule Meeting", choose a time slot, field a name, and click "Schedule Meeting"
	- "Close Timeslots" is confusing; there are 4 different ways to close time slots as demanded in the instruction:
		- (a) -> fill valid date and time
		- (b) -> choose weekday and fill valid date
		- (c) -> fill valid date
		- (d) -> fill valid time
		- Note: The case will be considered from (a) to (d). For example, in case of filling all, case (a) will be chosen. In case of filling date and weekday, case (c) will be chosen.
